## Solution
To get started i downloaded Minetest from the [official site](https://www.minetest.net/downloads/) and copied the provided files in
the game folder. Once started the game and joined the world i was greeted by a circuit.

I noticed a NOT gate dropped at the top left of the circuit so I tried to put it back in place.
At this point i was presented with the introduction to the next challenge and the flag.
